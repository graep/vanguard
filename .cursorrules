## CRITICAL: Git Operations
- NEVER commit changes to Git/GitHub without explicit user approval
- NEVER push changes to remote repositories without explicit user instruction
- ALWAYS ask for confirmation before running any git commit, push, or merge commands
- When staging files, inform the user but do not proceed to commit

## Code Changes
- Always ask before making destructive changes (deleting files, major refactoring)
- Confirm before installing new packages or dependencies
- Ask before modifying configuration files that could break the application

## Safety Guidelines
- Never access external APIs or systems without permission
- Never modify production environment settings
- Always preserve user data and important files
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous

## Communication
- Explain what changes will be made before implementing them
- Provide clear summaries of what was modified
- Ask for feedback on implementation approaches
- Respect user preferences and coding standards
